# Gold Stock Prices Project

## Coursera Developing Data Products 


This project aims to explore the correlation between Gold Companies Stock prices and the Gold Price. Gold is a pure commoditty, meaning it´s price is determined by the market, in this case the LME (London Metal Exchange). Given this, there are many gold mining companies listed at NYSE or TSX, i.e. In the project, given an start date and a end date, the app will show a chart comparing the Stock Prices and the Gold itself. Gold Prices are set in USD per Ounces (USD/AuOz), as the Stock Prices are set in USD. The app will also show the fitting for the Stock Price in function of the Gold Price and will let you select a new target Gold Price to estimated the price of an Stock if the gold gets this quotation. The prediction fitting is the same for the period selected above.

Please notice the first time the app runs it will gather external data, which may take a little while.
